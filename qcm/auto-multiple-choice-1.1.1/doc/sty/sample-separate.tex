\noindent{\bf AMC  \hfill SAMPLE TEST}

\vspace{3ex}

For this test, package {\sf automultiplechoice} is used with {\tt
  separateanswersheet} option, so that all answers are to be filled on
a separate sheet by students. Page markers are printed in view of an
automated marking from papers scans. DRAFT indications can be
cancelled using {\tt nowatermark} option.

Commands from {\sf automultiplechoice} are used to print, for each
student, two geography questions and two history questions, at
random. Questions and answers are shuffled.
