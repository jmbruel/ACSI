\noindent{\bf AMC  \hfill SAMPLE TEST}

\vspace{3ex}

For this test, package {\sf automultiplechoice} is used with the
following options:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt nopage}, so that no page markers are printed:
  nothing is planed for future automated marking from papers scans.
\item {\tt indivanswers}, so that correct answers are indicated (this
  is the corrected answer sheet. Without this option, you get the
  question sheet).
\end{itemize}
Commands from {\sf automultiplechoice} are used to print, for each
student, two geography questions and two history questions, at
random. Questions and answers are shuffled.
